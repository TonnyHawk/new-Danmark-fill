                  converts the sound of the bow on the strings to an electronic signal, which is then projected through
                  an amplifier or headphones. Electric violins are nearly silent without some type of speaker or
                  amplification device. The sound of an electric violin is slightly sharper than an acoustic violin, and
                  thee are generally better suited for more advanced players.</p>

                  will resonate and project sound naturally through the "F holes" of the instrument when you use the bow
                  on the strings. This is the more traditional type of violin.</p>
